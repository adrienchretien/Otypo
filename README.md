# Otypo

Otypo is an extension for Brackets that fix typographical syntax. For example, it replaces dumb quotes by UTF-8 smart quotes.

For now, it fix only selected parts of raw texts.

## What does it fix

- Apostrophes (`'` to closing single “curly” quote);
- Dashes (`--` to en dash and `---` to em-dash);
- Quotation marks (pairs of `'` and `"` to single and double “curly” quotes);
